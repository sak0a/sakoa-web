Thanks for your interest in donating! AlliedModders relies on your generosity to keep its sites and development running.

As a small incentive (and to show our appreciation), any donation above $5 gives you access to a private Donors' Only forum. The development team will read this forum frequently and give more attentive support for usage or development questions. It's a way to interact with the developers, to discuss anything on your mind, in an environment with a high signal to noise ratio.

Donors (above $1) also get listed on the Hall of Fame page from the main site. If your forum profile has a URL, it will appear there as well.

PayPal are currently having issues with website donation buttons, please make a donation by using the Send Money option from an existing PayPal account to paypal@alliedmods.net. We will automatically try and guess based on prior donations from the same PayPal account to match up the forum username, but if not you should receive an email afterwards to provide your forum username. If you don't receive an e-mail about your donor privileges, please contact support@alliedmods.net.
